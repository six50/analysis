### Scripts
From this directory, running `Rscript poll_tracker.R` will:
1. Download [`polls.csv`](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/sixfifty/polls.csv) and reshape it into the format required for visualisation.
2. Use ggplot to visualise polls plus add a smoothed LOESS line to each party's polling.
3. Export in as 1200x600 PNG file into the current local directory.
4. Upload using the AWS CLI into SixFifty's S3 bucket (this won't work unless you have AWS tokens plus required write permissions on this bucket).
